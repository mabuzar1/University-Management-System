# University-Management-System C++ Project
This University Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ to streamline academic and cafeteria-related operations. The project includes two primary modules:
Teacher Portal:
Manages student grades by calculating total marks based on lab performance, midterms, CEAs, and final term assessments.
Assigns grades based on user-defined criteria.
Saves student performance data into CSV files using file handling.
University Cafeteria:
Allows users to browse the menu, select items, and generate bills dynamically.
Features:
File Handling: Stores and retrieves student results in a structured format.
Modular Code Design: Ensures easy readability and maintainability.
Interactive Menus: Provides a user-friendly experience for both academic and cafeteria operations.
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of C++ programming, such as file handling, functions, and structured data processing. Perfect for academic purposes and practical learning.
